The goal of this repo is to have a few internal iterations before we go on
GitHub.

We follow the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
(I'm open to other suggestions.)

# Notes

  * I abandoned the term 'vBucket' and replaced it by 'trait.' I find it too
    confusing.
  * I haven't made up my mind RE: handles vs. objects. Let's keep an open mind
    unless one of you has arguments / experience / strong feelings in a
    particular direction.
